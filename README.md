# Breast-Cancer

### The dataset for this project has been taken from Kaggle.
### I have used Google Colab to execute the code

#### The main purpose of the project is to predict Breast Cancer using different models and compare the performance of several models

____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
#### The project consists of visualization using a pie chart and histogram


#### The models that have been used are-
    i) Dummy Classifier
    ii) Support Vector Classifier
    iii) Passive Aggressive Classifier
    iv) Logistic Regression
    v) Perceptron
    vi) Random Forest Classifier
    
#### The project compares these models using accuracy score and uses a bar chart to visualize and compare the accuracy scores of the models
